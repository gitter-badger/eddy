Eddy is a graphical editor for the specification and visualization of Graphol ontologies. 
Eddy features a design environment specifically thought out for generating Graphol ontologies through 
ad-hoc functionalities. Drawing features allow designers to comfortably edit ontologies in a central 
viewport area, while two lateral docking areas contains specifically-tailored widgets for editing, 
navigating and inspecing open diagrams. 

In order to support interaction with third-party tools such as OWL 2 reasoners and editors like [Protégé], 
Eddy is able to export the produced Graphol ontology into an OWL 2 ontology. Other simpler exporting file 
formats, like PDF, are also currently provided.

Eddy is written in [Python] and make use of the [PyQt5] python bindings for the cross-platform [Qt5] framework. 

### About Graphol

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/danielepantaleone/eddy](https://badges.gitter.im/danielepantaleone/eddy.svg)](https://gitter.im/danielepantaleone/eddy?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

[Graphol] is a novel language for the specification and visualization of Description Logic (DL) ontologies, 
developed by members of the DASI-lab group of the [Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Automatica e Gestionale "A.Ruberti"] 
at [Sapienza] University of Rome. Graphol  offers a completely visual representation of ontologies to users, in order to help 
understanding by people who are not skilled in logic. Graphol provides designers with simple graphical primitives for ontology 
editing, avoiding complex textual syntax. Graphol's basic components are inspired by Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams, thus 
ontologies that can be rendered as ER diagrams have in Graphol a similar diagrammatic shape.
